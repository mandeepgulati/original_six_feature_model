"""Populate the local FRED cache with series used by the food-price and S&P 500 experiments.

Each FRED series in ``FRED_SERIES`` below is fetched from the FRED REST API
and written to ``data/fred/{fred_id}.parquet``.  Subsequent calls to
:class:`~aieng.forecasting.data.adapters.FREDAdapter` read directly from
those parquet files — no further network access is required.

The catalogue is the union of two experiments' covariates:

- **Food-price forecasting** (:data:`FOOD_FRED_SERIES`): monthly US food CPI
  sub-indices plus Canadian macro series, consumed directly at monthly (MS)
  frequency.
- **S&P 500 forecasting** (:data:`FRED_PREFETCH_REGISTRY`, imported from
  ``sp500_forecasting.data``): daily and monthly US macro series that the S&P
  500 covariate builders transform and align themselves. This script only warms
  the raw parquet cache; ``fetch_sp500_market.py`` handles the Yahoo covariates.

Re-running the script is idempotent: any series already cached is re-read
from disk and re-validated.  Pass ``--refresh`` to force a fresh download.

**Prerequisite:** set ``FRED_API_KEY`` in your environment or in the
repo-root ``.env`` file.  A free key is available at
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html.

# Food-price forecasting covariates.
#
# Rationale for inclusion:
#   - US food CPI sub-indices: US prices transmit to Canadian food costs
#     through trade and supply chains, especially for commodities.
#   - Canadian 10-year bond yield: measures cost of capital and credit
#     conditions affecting food production and distribution.
#   - Canada/US exchange rate: direct pass-through to import food prices.
#   - Canada unemployment rate: labour-market covariate for the BoC
#     rate-decision experiment (implementations/boc_rate_decisions/).
#
# All food series are published at monthly (MS) frequency on FRED, which
# matches the Statistics Canada food CPI target frequency.
